          <p>
            A Rug Check evaluates a token's smart contract and on-chain activity to identify potential rug pull risksâ€”a scam
            where developers abandon a project after collecting funds. Below are the key metrics analyzed:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Insider Activity:</strong> Monitors wallets with suspicious trading patterns, such as large or
              coordinated transactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mint Authority:</strong> Checks if developers can mint new tokens, which could dilute the token's
              value.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Freeze Authority:</strong> Verifies if developers can freeze token transfers, potentially locking user
              funds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Burn Status:</strong> Assesses the percentage of tokens burned to reduce supply and enhance scarcity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Liquidity Lock:</strong> Ensures liquidity is locked to prevent sudden withdrawals by developers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Contract Security:</strong> Confirms if the contract is renounced (immutable) or upgradeable
              (modifiable).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Risk Score combines these metrics to provide an overall risk assessment, with lower scores indicating safer
            tokens. Always conduct your own research before investing.
